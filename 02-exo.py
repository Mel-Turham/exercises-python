# This Python code is a simple authentication system. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

# The lines `passWord = 'testpassword'` and `user_name = 'william'` are initializing variables in
# Python.
passWord = 'testpassword'
user_name = 'william'
# The lines `input_password = input('Please enter your password ... : ')` and `input_user_name =
# input('Please enter your user name ... : ')` are prompting the user to enter their password and
# username respectively. The `input()` function in Python is used to take user input from the console.
# In this case, the user is being asked to input their password and username for authentication
# purposes in the code.
input_password = input('Please enter your password ... : ')
input_user_name = input('Please enter your user name ... : ')
# The line `message = print("Please enter the correct password and correct user name :( ")` is
# assigning the result of the `print()` function to the variable `message`.
message =  print("Please enter the correct password and correct user name :( ")

# The `while` loop in the code snippet you provided is used for authentication purposes. It continues
# to prompt the user to enter their password and username until both the entered password and username
# match the predefined values (`passWord` and `user_name` respectively).
while passWord  != input_password and user_name != input_user_name:
  input_password = input('Please enter your password ... : ')
  input_user_name = input('Please enter your user name ... : ')
  if(passWord != input_password or user_name != input_user_name):
    message
# The code snippet you provided is checking if the entered password (`input_password`) matches the
# predefined password (`passWord`) and if the entered username (`input_user_name`) matches the
# predefined username (`user_name`).
    
if passWord == input_password and input_user_name == user_name:
   # The line `print(f"Welcome {user_name}, you logged successfully :)")` is responsible for
   # displaying a welcome message to the user upon successful authentication. The `f` before the
   # string indicates an f-string in Python, allowing for the interpolation of variables within the
   # string. In this case, `{user_name}` will be replaced with the actual username of the
   # authenticated user when the message is displayed.
    print(f"Welcome {user_name}, you logged successfully :)")
